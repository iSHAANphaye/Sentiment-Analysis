# Sentiment Analysis
 
This repository contains a machine learning (ML) model for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves analyzing and classifying textual data to determine the sentiment expressed within the text. This model predicts whether a given piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Model Overview
* The sentiment analysis model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning algorithm. 
It is trained on a dataset of labeled text samples, where each sample is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.
* The model learns patterns and features from the text to make predictions about the sentiment of unseen text.

## Model Features
* Preprocessing: The model preprocesses the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters. It also tokenizes the text and converts it to lowercase.
* Feature Extraction: The model uses a bag-of-words approach to represent text samples as numerical vectors. It also employs feature selection techniques to select the most informative features.
* Algorithm: The model uses a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification. This classifier is well-suited for text classification tasks and works with the probabilistic nature of text data.
## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy, Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
